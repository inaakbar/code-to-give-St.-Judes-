# Code To Give-St.Judes(Team-S6)
User friendly responsive interface with offline mode and multilingual functionality where beneficiaries can generate requests.
</br>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
There is a need of a platform for St. Jude's where beneficiaries can interact with the SJFL team members and there is no proper system for users for collection of documents which makes the whole process tiring and time consuming. A platform is needed where users can generate requests without any difficulty.
</br>
<h2>Our Solution</h2>
We created a user friendly platform where beneficiaries can generate requests for all type of needs. The application requires minimal data connectivity and pages can be viewed even when they lose their internet connection. The data get stored when they lose connectivity and moves to the backend once connection is restored hence users donâ€™t need to worry about losing connection.
